// A page for every flow the flowverse releases that nobody here has written one for.
//
// The hand-written pages (`flows/*.md`, one per flow in `theme/flows.ts`) are the ones with a
// diagram and the prose that says when to reach for a flow. But the flowverse is open: anybody
// may release a flow into it, and a catalogue that only listed what this repository had heard of
// would be wrong the day after a release. So a module with no hand-written page gets one built
// from its README, at the commit its newest release pins, under the facts strip every flow page
// has. Writing a page for it by hand -- and listing it in `theme/flows.ts` -- replaces this.

/** A README is written for GitHub, and this puts it on a page of ours: its own title goes
 *  (ours replaces it, with the flow's name as hmz calls it), as do its badges and its table of
 *  contents (the page has an outline), and every relative link and image -- inline, with a
 *  title, by reference, or in raw HTML -- is pointed back at the repository, since none of them
 *  exist on this site. Code is left as it was written. The whole is wrapped in `v-pre`, so a
 *  `{{` anywhere in it is text rather than Vue. */
