gem5's build system was ported from SCons to CMake in full by one engineer directing agents
for weeks. The result is [gem5/gem5#2969](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/pull/2969): **567 files
changed** across **133 commits**. CMake + Ninja becomes the build, and a Bazel build runs
alongside it without touching a single source file.

This is the oldest result on this page and, for what we were trying to learn, one of the most
useful. A build-system migration is the least glamorous long-horizon task there is, and it has
almost none of the properties that make a benchmark flattering.

## The scale

Most of the change is a swap: 193 SCons files out, 147 CMake files in. Then there is the long
tail of everything that named the old build, such as a binary path in a config, a command in a
Dockerfile or a step in a CI job. None of it is hard, and all of it has to be found.

## Two builds, one source tree

The port had one hard constraint, which is that the source tree does not move. gem5 generates
a large part of its own C++ (the ISA parser, the SLICC protocol compiler, the SimObject
wrappers, the embedded Python), and every one of those pipelines had to come across unchanged
and keep running on the same Python tools.

## Why this task taught us the most

There is no clever insight to have, and no moment where a good idea collapses the search. There
is a very large number of mechanical changes, each of them easy. The build either works or does
not, and there is a long stretch in the middle where it does not work for a reason that has
nothing to do with the change you just made.

An agent left unsupervised will eventually declare victory on a build that compiles only part of
the tree. What held this one together was the loop around the agents: a plan agreed up front,
then rounds of building under an independent review. That loop was RLCR Flow, then a
Claude Code plugin. It now lives on as the [humanize1 flow](/flows/humanize1), the same
plan-then-review loop run by Humanize. This task is why we started caring about the loop rather than the model, and it is
the kind of task [FlowBench](/projects/flowbench) is being assembled from.
