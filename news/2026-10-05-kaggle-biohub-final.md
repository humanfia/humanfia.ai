[On 15 August](/news/2026-08-15-kaggle-nineteen-competitions), one of our agent workflows on
Kaggle was **8th of 2,378** on the public leaderboard of
[Biohub – Cell Tracking During Development](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/biohub-cell-tracking-during-development).
That was the top 0.34%. It was among the ongoing results we reported then, under a note that
the numbers were still moving.

The competition has closed. The authenticated final private rank is **188th of 3,947**, the
**top 4.76%**. That is a genuine top-5% finish on a closed board. It is also 188th, not 8th.

We do not know how much of the gap is the private board reshuffling and how much is everything
that happened after 15 August: 1,569 more teams entered, and the rest of the field kept
improving.<Sidenote>2,378 teams on 15 August, 3,947 at the close.</Sidenote> The point stands
either way.

> A public rank in the middle of a competition is a weather report.

We said so in August, and this is what it looks like.

## The other boards that closed

Four of the competitions that were open in August now have final private ranks. Drag the divider
to see each board then and now.

Biohub fell the furthest. PTCG AI Battle rose, and Hyperspectral Detection held its place in a
field almost eight times larger. The boards still open moved
too: Solar Filament Segmentation went from 7th of 296 in August to 149th of 872 today.

One more closed with a striking number we cannot yet count.
[Predicting Smartphone Addiction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s6e8)
shows an account at **2nd of 3,531**, but on the *public* board as of the snapshot. That
account's final private rank has not been recorded. The best authenticated private rank we
have there is 564th. Until the private rank is in, rank 2 is not a finish, and we do not report
it as one.

## The tally, counting only final ranks

The [AgentKaggle Team Radar](https://agentkaggle.github.io/leaderboard/visualizations/)
(snapshot 2026-10-05 09:18 UTC) tracks **39** completed competitions. Taking the best tracked
result in each, **16** are in the top 5%. Most of those are not finishes.

The audit's
[charts](https://github.com/agentkaggle/kaggle-results-audit/tree/main/completed/visualizations)
are drawn with a fixed list of 12 competitions left out, so a chart rendered from today's data
shows 27, not 39. All 12 are outside the top 15%, so leaving them out flatters the picture. The
counts above use all 39. Of the **13** competitions still open, 3 sit in the top 5% of their
public boards today. One of those 3 is Spaceship Titanic, a getting-started practice
competition.

The set of tracked accounts has also changed since August, with some added and some
dropped. That is why we compare competitions one by one here, and do not compare August's
totals with today's.
