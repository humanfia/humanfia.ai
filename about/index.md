<!--
  The team and the about page are one page now, and the team comes first. Humanfia is a group of
  people more than it is a mission statement, so the faces are what About opens on; what we
  believe is short enough to sit underneath them. /team/ redirects here (public/team/index.html)
  and keeps its hash, so /team/#hoa lands on #hoa.

  `#how-we-work` is linked from projects/hka.md and a blog post. Rename that heading and both
  of them drop the reader at the top of the page -- `pnpm check:anchors` will say so.

# About

> Humanize is part of NVIDIA RSI effort

<p class="lede">We build the flow around the agent: the method, the referee, and the
applications that show whether an agent finishes the work or just starts it impressively. These
are the people who do it.</p>

<TeamRoster />

<div class="about-rest">

## The bet

A better model writes a better function; it does not, on its own, work for eleven hours, hold
on to a constraint from round one, and stop when the job is done. That is the loop around the
agent, and we think the loop is what lasts — models are rented and replaced, a method can be
written down, measured and improved. So we build methods, give them away, and score them
against each other in public; when one of ours loses, it goes.

## How we work

<ol class="principles">
  <li><b>The person decides what done means.</b> People own the intent, the tradeoffs and the
  definition of done. Agents are leverage inside that, not a replacement for it.</li>
  <li><b>The builder is not the judge.</b> Every serious flow has a second agent that arrives
  with no memory of the work and reads the repository instead.</li>
  <li><b>Reward hacking is the normal failure.</b> Long runs fail by <em>looking</em> finished —
  a narrowed test, a special case, a stub under a confident summary. Our reviewers hunt for
  exactly that.</li>
  <li><b>If it is not measured, it is a preference.</b> <a href="/projects/flowbench">FlowBench</a>
  is us agreeing in advance to find out whether our flows are right, and to delete the ones
  that are not.</li>
  <li><b>Build in public.</b> The runtime, the flows and the reproduction code are open source.
  When we publish a number, we publish what it takes to check it.</li>
</ol>
