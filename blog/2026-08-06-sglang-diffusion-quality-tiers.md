title: A quality tier for the fast kernels
description: Most profitable diffusion fusions change the output at the level of bf16 rounding order, enough to fail a bitwise CI and not enough for a person to see. So we gave the request a quality tier instead of arguing about the diff.

A large share of the profitable kernel fusions in a diffusion serving stack change the output
only at the level of **bf16 rounding order**. Folding the FFN tanh-GELU into the up-projection
GEMM as a cuBLASLt epilogue is the canonical example: mathematically the same computation, a
different order of operations, and therefore a different last bit.

SGLang's diffusion CI compares generated images **bitwise** against the reference. So none of
these fusions could ever land on the default path. This is not hypothetical. An ungated FLUX
GELU fusion was merged as [#28166](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/28166), with
pixels a mean 2.56 out of 255 from main, and reverted four days later in
[#28708](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/28708) because it "can move generated
images away from the original model behavior".

The usual next move is to argue about the tolerance in CI. That trade is bad in both directions:
loosen it and the guarantee everyone relies on is gone; keep it and a whole class of real
speedups is unshippable.

## The tier

[#33453](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/33453) gives every request a
`quality` of `lossless` or `high`, and nothing else:

- **`lossless`**, the default, is the exact reference path. Its output stays byte-identical, the
  ground-truth CI stays green, and nobody's guarantee changed.
- **`high`** opts into validated fast paths whose deviation is bounded and visually
  indistinguishable.

Within two days, six fast paths had shipped behind it, including the GELU fusion that had been
reverted in June.

## A claim with a gate

"Visually indistinguishable" is a claim, so it has a gate. #33453 sets the bar at a same-seed
**PSNR above 25 dB** against the lossless output, and leaves enforcing it to follow-up work;
every fast path that shipped under the tier reports it, with side-by-side samples. The six
kernel fast paths of the first two days measured **34.7 to 59.1 dB**. The one figure near the
bar belongs to the tier's first consumer, which is not a kernel at all: a caching policy for
MiniMax-H3, at 28.2 dB.<Sidenote>We first wrote that 34–58 dB was measured across every pull
request shipped under the tier. The kernel range is 34.7–59.1 dB, and the caching policy sits
lower, at 28.16 dB.</Sidenote>

Set that against what each one buys, and the two kinds of deviation separate cleanly. Kernel
fusions save a few percent and stay far above the bar. Skipping work by caching saves far more,
and spends most of the margin.

/>

The general lesson is not about diffusion. When correctness is a spectrum and the CI has to be a
boolean, the fix is usually to make the request say which end of the spectrum it wants, rather
than to move the boolean.

> When correctness is a spectrum and the CI is a boolean, let the request choose.
